version 1.0

## Description:
This is going to be a back end api of students, teachers, and classes. There will a seperate repo for a react front end that will consume this API.


## Visuals

I want to keep the data in this API tidy so I read up on relational database planning and came up with this ERD to help me plan out my models. It feels pretty clean compared to my original effort.



## endpoints:
set up soon....


## Project status
Actively in development.
